# BRI Hackathon
### This is my submission for BRI Hackathon whose theme is "Cash Ratio Optimization". 
#### Background : 
The lack of efficiency in managing cash circulating in the field, both in work units, CRM (Cash Recycle Machine) and ATM (Automated Teller Machine) machines increases operational costs and loses potential use of cash for BRI's banking business. 
#### Objective : 
provide recommendations for accurate cash management so that it is expected to reduce operational costs and reduce the loss of BRI business opportunities in using cash.
#### Strategy : 
build a machine learning-based model with Prophet, which is package created by Data Science team of Facebook, to conduct time-series forecasting
